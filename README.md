  <h1>TensorFlow Distributed Training Example with Beans Dataset</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>This code provides a short example for testing and benchmarking the TensorFlow framework's capabilities in distributed training using the beans dataset.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Loads the "beans" dataset using TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS).</li>
    <li>Implements a basic convolutional neural network (CNN) model for image classification.</li>
    <li>Employs distributed training with MirroredStrategy (potentially using multiple GPUs).</li>
    <li>Demonstrates data wrangling and augmentation techniques for training.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Note</h2>
  <p>This is a simplified example and might not be suitable for production use cases. It's intended to showcase core functionalities for getting started with distributed training in TensorFlow.</p>

  <h2>Running the script</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Ensure you have TensorFlow and TensorFlow Datasets installed (`pip install tensorflow tensorflow-datasets`).</li>
    <li>Download the "beans" dataset using TFDS (instructions might be needed depending on the dataset).</li>
    <li>Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., epochs, batch size) if needed.</li>
    <li>Run the script: `python your_script_name.py`</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Further considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This example uses a basic CNN architecture. Explore more advanced architectures and parameter tuning for better performance on your specific task.</li>
    <li>Consider using more robust data augmentation techniques for improved model generalization.</li>
    <li>This script focuses on demonstrating distributed training. Explore additional functionalities like model saving, loading, and evaluation for complete training workflows.</li>
  </ul>
